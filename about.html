    <h2>About the College</h2>
    <p>
      Dhamma Nandi Buddhist College was founded in 2019 (B.E. 2563) with the aim of nurturing
      both monastic and lay students in the light of the Buddha’s teachings. The college seeks
      to cultivate wisdom, compassion, and mindfulness, while providing opportunities for higher
      education in Buddhist and secular studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our college campus provides a serene and disciplined atmosphere suitable for spiritual
      practice and academic learning. Through our programs, students learn not only the theory
      of Dhamma but also how to apply it in daily life to create a peaceful and harmonious society.
